### Computational Musicology
##### Why I chose this course
As a third year AI bachelor student I already encountered two courses about music and the role of AI or atleast computers in interpreting music. For my 'tweedejaarsproject' I worked with a dataset of the Eurovision Song Festival. When I was younger, music (in physics) was my least favourite subject, but the more I learned about it, the more I came to love it.

##### My corpus
I would like to find out how music across genres changed over time. For example, how did rock evolve over the years? I think that I will start using one or two corpora for example rock and pop.

##### Challenges
Finding corpora which are good representations of their age will be the biggest challenge, because music differs a lot between artists. A lot of thought should go in to the definition and representation of each <em>musical era</em>
